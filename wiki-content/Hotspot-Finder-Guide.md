# Hotspot Finder Guide

The Hotspot Finder is EliteMining's most powerful feature, providing access to 32,000+ confirmed mining hotspots with detailed location data, material information, and intelligent filtering.

## üåü Overview

The Hotspot Finder helps you:
- **Find optimal mining rings** near your current location
- **Filter by specific materials** you want to mine
- **Compare ring densities** and hotspot counts
- **Track visited vs unvisited** systems
- **Plan efficient mining routes**

## üöÄ Basic Usage

### 1. System Search
1. **Enter reference system** in the search box
   - Type your current system name
   - Or click **"Use Current System"** (auto-detects from journal)
2. **Set search distance** (recommended: 10-50 LY)
3. **Click Search**

### 2. Filter Results
- **Ring Type:** Filter by Metallic, Rocky, Icy, or Metal Rich
- **Material:** Search for specific materials (Platinum, Painite, etc.)
- **Max Results:** Limit results for faster loading

### 3. Interpret Results
Each result shows:
- **Distance** from your reference system
- **LS Distance** from system arrival point
- **System Name** and **Ring Name**
- **Visited Status** (Yes/No based on your journal history)
- **Ring Type** (Metallic, Rocky, Icy, Metal Rich)
- **Hotspots** available in that ring
- **Density** rating when available

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Material-Specific Searching
**For Laser Mining:**
- Search for: `Platinum`, `Painite`, `Osmium`
- Focus on: Metallic and Metal Rich rings
- Look for: High hotspot overlap counts

**For Core Mining:**  
- Search for: `Void Opals`, `Low Temperature Diamonds`
- Focus on: Icy rings
- Look for: Dense ring formations

### Smart Filtering Tips
1. **Start broad** - Search "All Materials" first to see all options
2. **Narrow down** - Then filter by specific material
3. **Consider distance** - Balance travel time vs ring quality
4. **Check visited status** - Prioritize unvisited systems for exploration

### Understanding Ring Density
- **Higher density** = More asteroids per cubic kilometer
- **Better performance** = Faster material collection
- **Quality indicator** = Denser rings often have better yields

## üìä Database Information

### Data Sources
- **32,000+ hotspots** from community mining reports
- **Ring composition** data from system surveys  
- **Coordinates** from EDSM and player submissions
- **Density measurements** from mining analytics

### Auto-Import Features
EliteMining automatically:
- ‚úÖ **Scans your journals** for new hotspot discoveries
- ‚úÖ **Updates visited systems** when you jump
- ‚úÖ **Tracks mining activity** to improve recommendations
- ‚úÖ **Adds new locations** to the database

## üîç Search Strategies

### Finding New Mining Spots
1. **Use your current system** as reference
2. **Search within 20-30 LY** for reasonable travel time
3. **Filter by desired material** 
4. **Sort by distance** to find closest options
5. **Prioritize unvisited systems** for exploration

### Planning Mining Routes
1. **Search multiple reference points** along your route
2. **Bookmark promising locations** for later
3. **Note ring types** for different materials
4. **Consider station proximity** for selling

### Efficiency Tips
- **Bookmark frequently used** reference systems
- **Use "All Materials"** to discover unexpected opportunities  
- **Check multiple ring types** - some systems have both Metallic and Icy
- **Compare densities** when multiple options available

## üè∑Ô∏è Bookmarking System

### Save Favorite Locations
1. **Right-click any result** 
2. **Select "Add Bookmark"**
3. **Add personal notes** about the location
4. **Organize by material type** or region

### Bookmark Management
- **View all bookmarks** in the Mining Session tab
- **Edit notes and ratings** for each location
- **Export bookmark lists** for sharing
- **Import community bookmark sets**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
**Check these:**
- ‚úÖ System name spelling (try partial names)
- ‚úÖ Search distance (increase if needed)
- ‚úÖ Material filter (try "All Materials" first)
- ‚úÖ Internet connection (for coordinate lookup)

### Inaccurate Data
**Report issues:**
- Outdated hotspot information
- Incorrect ring compositions
- Missing or wrong coordinates
- Systems that no longer exist

### Performance Issues
**Optimize searches:**
- Reduce max results for faster loading
- Use more specific material filters
- Clear old bookmark data periodically
- Restart EliteMining if searches become slow

## üí° Pro Tips

### Community Integration
- **Share discoveries** by reporting new hotspots
- **Join mining expeditions** organized through the community
- **Contribute data** to improve the database
- **Follow mining guides** for optimal techniques

### Advanced Workflows
1. **Multi-system planning** - Search several systems for route optimization
2. **Material specialization** - Focus on 2-3 materials for expertise
3. **Market integration** - Combine with trading tools for profit optimization
4. **Fleet carrier support** - Plan routes for carrier-based operations

### Data Analysis
- **Track your success rates** at different locations
- **Compare actual yields** vs hotspot counts
- **Note time-of-day impacts** on ring populations
- **Monitor BGS effects** on mining availability

## üìà Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Real-time player density tracking
- Community rating systems
- Enhanced filtering options
- Integration with fleet carrier networks
- Mobile companion app
