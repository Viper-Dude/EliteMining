## Firegroup Configuration

### Required Firegroups
Configure these firegroups for automation:

**Mining Lasers (Primary)**
- Assign mining lasers to designated firegroup
- Set as primary fire for main mining
- Configure laser count and type

**Prospector Limpets (Secondary)**
- Assign prospector limpet controller
- Set to secondary fire button

## Mining Automation Sequences

### Standard Mining Workflow
Typical voice-controlled mining session:

1. **"Open Configurator"** - Launch EliteMining
2. **Navigate to mining location** (manual flight)
3. **"Start Mining Sequence"** - Begin automated mining
4. **"Deploy Prospector Limpets"** - Target valuable asteroids
5. **Continue mining cycle** until cargo full
6. **"Stop Mining Sequence"** - End session and review
