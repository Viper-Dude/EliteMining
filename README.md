## üì¶ Requirements

**Essential:**
- **Elite Dangerous** (PC version)

**For Voice Command Automation:**
- **[EliteVA (API) by Somfic](https://docs.somfic.dev/projects/eliteva)**  
- **[VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com/)** ‚Äì Paid version  
- **Working microphone** for voice commands  

**Note:** VoiceAttack is optional - the Configurator can run standalone for mining announcements, session tracking, and manual configuration without any voice automation.

---

## üíæ Installation

- **Installer**: Run `EliteMiningSetup.exe` for complete installation with VoiceAttack profile
- **Portable**: Extract `EliteMining_3.9.0-beta.zip` for manual installation

### Manual Installation Steps:
1. Download the latest release from [this repository](https://github.com/Viper-Dude/EliteMining/releases)  
2. Extract all contents of the downloaded file into your VoiceAttack app folder  
3. Open VoiceAttack ‚Üí **Profile > Import Profile**  
4. Select **EliteMining-Profile.vap**

## üñ•Ô∏è Configurator

The **Configurator** is a standalone tool included with EliteMining. It provides a graphical interface to easily adjust firegroups, toggles, timers, and announcement options without editing VoiceAttack directly.

If you prefer manual control over automated sequences and don't want voice commands, the Configurator can be used as a standalone application for mining announcements, session reports, and configuration management - VoiceAttack is not required for these features.

### Launching the Configurator
- Say **"Open Configurator"** in VoiceAttack, **or**  
- Press **Right Ctrl + Right Shift + C** on your keyboard.
- - Outside Voiceattack, run Elitemining (shortcuts from desktop) or from folder \EliteMining\Configurator\Configurator.exe 

### Using the Configurator
1. **Dashboard - Firegroups & FireButtons Tab** ‚Äì Assign Fire Buttons and Firegroups.  
2. **Dashboard - Timers/Toggles Tab** ‚Äì Enable or disable functions.  
3. **Mining Session Tab** ‚Äì Provides tools for in-game mining operations (Prospector, Announcement Panel, Mining Session, Reports).
