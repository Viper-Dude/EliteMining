# 🚀 EliteMining 3.9.0-beta
**VoiceAttack Profile for Elite Dangerous Mining Operations**

## 🎯 Usage Options

### VoiceAttack Integration (Full Automation)
Complete voice-controlled mining with automated sequences and announcements.

### Standalone Mode (Manual Control)
For pilots who prefer manual mining without automated sequences or voice commands, the Configurator works independently to provide mining announcements, session tracking, and ship configuration. VoiceAttack is not required for these features.

## 📦 Requirements

**Essential:**
- **Elite Dangerous** (PC version)

**For Voice Command Automation:**
- **[EliteVA (API) by Somfic](https://docs.somfic.dev/projects/eliteva)**  
- **[VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com/)** – Paid version  
- **Working microphone** for voice commands  

**Note:** VoiceAttack is optional - the Configurator can run standalone for mining announcements, session tracking, and manual configuration without any voice automation.

## 💾 Installation

- **Installer**: Run `EliteMiningSetup.exe` for complete installation with VoiceAttack profile
- **Portable**: Extract `EliteMining_3.9.0-beta.zip` for standalone use
