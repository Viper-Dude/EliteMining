## Requirements
<details open>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Essential:**  
- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Elite Dangerous** (PC version)  

**For VoiceAttack Integration:**  
- **[EliteVA (API) by Somfic](https://docs.somfic.dev/projects/eliteva)** *(included in installer)*  
- **[VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com/)** – Paid version  
- **Microphone** for voice commands  


### Keybind Requirement for EliteVA

EliteVA requires a custom keybinds file (such as `Custom.binds`, `Custom.*.binds`, or an HCS `Custom.*.*.binds` file):

- If you already use a custom keybinds file (for example, from HCS VoicePacks or your own setup), you’re all set—no changes needed.
- If you don’t have a custom keybinds file yet:
  1. Open **Elite Dangerous → Options → Controls**
  2. Set preset to **Custom**
  3. For each controller you want to use (keyboard, mouse, joystick, HOTAS, gamepad), make sure to assign at least one key or button in each of the four controller sections (Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Gamepad).  
     - This ensures Elite Dangerous saves your bindings for all devices.
  4. Click **Save** — this will create or update your `Custom.binds` file (or a similarly named custom file).

**Tip:**  
If you use multiple controllers, always check that each one is recognized and has at least one binding set before saving. This prevents missing controls in your custom binds file.

### Custom Keybinds for Mining Control  
VoiceAttack profile includes a dedicated **"Custom Keybinds for Mining Control"** category. Configure your mining hotkeys here instead of searching through the entire profile.

**Note:** VoiceAttack is optional. EliteMining App can run standalone.

## Installation

- **Installer:** Run `EliteMiningSetup.exe` (includes VoiceAttack profile)  

> **Antivirus Notice:** If your antivirus flags the application, this is a common false positive with Python-compiled apps - simply add an exclusion for the installation folder.
> 
> **After Updates and New Installs:** System/ring location may appear empty until you relog into Elite Dangerous (one-time refresh).

### Included Components  
The installer bundles the **EliteVA plugin**. No separate download required.  

### VoiceAttack  Installation  
1. Open VoiceAttack → Profile → Import Profile  
2. Select **EliteMining v4.76-Profile.vap** (versioned format)  
3. Configure your mining hotkeys in the **"Custom Keybinds for Mining Control"** category

### Enable VoiceAttack Plugins
VoiceAttack must have plugin support enabled and both EliteMining and EliteAPI plugins activated:

1. Open **VoiceAttack → Options → General**
2. Enable **"Enable Plugin Support"** checkbox
3. Click **"Plugin Manager"**
4. Enable these plugins:
   - ✓ **EliteMining Plugin v1.0.0**
   - ✓ **EliteAPI (v4 EliteVA.dll)**
5. Click **OK** and **restart VoiceAttack** for changes to take effect

<img src="https://github.com/Viper-Dude/EliteMining/blob/main/Screenshot/voiceattack_plugin.png" width="900"><br>  
*Enable both EliteMining and EliteAPI plugins in VoiceAttack*

**Note:** Plugin changes require a VoiceAttack restart.

**Note (v4.76+):** Keybind preservation is now automatic! When updating, EliteMining will prompt you to export your profile and automatically merge your keybinds into the new version.

### Preserving Keybinds During Updates (v4.76+)
EliteMining now automatically detects when a new VoiceAttack profile is available and guides you through keybind preservation:
1. Start EliteMining after updating
2. Follow the on-screen prompt to export your current profile as XML
3. Select the exported file
4. Your keybinds will be automatically merged into the new profile
5. Import the updated profile in VoiceAttack

**Manual method:** You can also export your profile beforehand (Profile → Export Profile, save as XML format) and use it during the merge process.

### Adding Custom Commands

**Recommended:** Create a separate profile for your custom commands instead of editing the EliteMining profile directly.

1. In VoiceAttack, create a new profile (e.g., "My Custom Commands")
2. Add your custom commands to this profile
3. Open the EliteMining profile → **Profile Options** → **Include Commands from Other Profiles**
4. Select your custom profile from the list

<img src="https://github.com/Viper-Dude/EliteMining/blob/main/Screenshot/voiceattack_profile_options.png" width="900"><br>  
*Include custom profiles to add your own commands without modifying EliteMining*

**Benefits:**
- Your custom commands won't be overwritten during EliteMining updates
- Easy to enable/disable your customizations
- Clean separation between EliteMining and personal commands
- Keybind merger won't affect your custom profile

**Note:** Commands in EliteMining profile take priority over included profiles if names conflict.

## Mining Presets
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Hazardous Mining Preset  
- **Command:** `"Set mining configuration for 3 x haz"`  
- Pre-configured firegroups, timers, and toggles for HAZ mining.  

### Customization  
- Create and manage ship presets via the **EliteMining App UI**
- Adjust firegroups/timers on-the-fly  
- Modify via built-in commands  

</details>

[Back to Top](#top)

## Usage Tips
- **Short press** → Starts command  
- **Long press** → Stops/resets command  
- Enable **"Shortcut is invoked when long-pressed"** in VoiceAttack  

[Back to Top](#top)

---



## Known Limitations
- **Only works with in-game keybinds (HOTAS setup manual)**
- **Works with EDCopilot**

> **Note:** VoiceAttack startup warnings about EliteVA plugin bindings are normal due to recent Elite Dangerous changes and can be safely ignored – they don't impact EliteMining voice commands.
