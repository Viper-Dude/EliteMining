**Release Date:** 2025-01-03

## ⚠️ Important for VoiceAttack Users

**Why this change?** This one-time XML format change enables automatic keybind preservation in future updates (v4.7.6+). No more reconfiguring keybinds after every update!

### Voiceattack Profile
- **Profile format changed to XML** for better compatibility and future keybind preservation
- **One-time keybind reconfiguration required** after importing this update
- Future updates (v4.7.6+) will automatically preserve your keybinds

**Important:** Import the new profile and reconfigure your keybinds. See [README.md](../README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Note:** Starting with v4.7.6, you'll be prompted to export your profile as XML before updates to automatically preserve your keybinds.
